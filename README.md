We created this app to help you make easier to organize your party or event. in this app you can find useful features like a search engine to look for the best place where you van get your party needs and make sure you have the most rated one as well as find the address and see the location on a map. In this app you can also post services that you are looking for in the helpful forum we have and get responses from people. We also added a view where you can put in your party info and get a virtual invitation and put your pending task so that way you don't forget them. To have access to this we added a login feature. In addition we put a contact section so you can contact us by email or social media, you can rate this page and share it on social media as well if you want your friends to be able to organize parties in an easier way. Everything in one place.
